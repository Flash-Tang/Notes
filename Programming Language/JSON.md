# JSON

JSON is built on two structures:

+ A collection of name/value pairs.
+ An ordered list of values. 

In JSON, they take on these forms:

+ An ***object*** is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with `{`left brace and ends with `}`right brace. Each name is followed by `:`colon and the name/value pairs are separated by `,`comma.

  > a name is a string.

+ An ***array*** is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with `[`left bracket and ends with `]`right bracket. Values are separated by `,`comma.

+ A ***value*** can be a *string* in double quotes, or a *number*, or `true` or `false` or `null`, or an *object* or an *array*. These structures can be nested.

+ A ***string*** is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes.
